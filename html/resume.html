        I want to finish college, get a good job or specifically applying on a IT company, work hard, earn money and
        treat my family to te places they want to go. I will buy everthing i wanted and will treasure all my hard work.
        I started pre-school in Matina Alliance Pre-School in Davao City, then staring my elementary days in Mang Tomas
        Elementary School. Then When i reached 3rd Grade my parents decided to move to Bohol and continue my journey
        there, i grew up at Bohol from 3rd grade-6th grade, i created tons of memories there, found new freinds and
        became a back-to-back Dancesports Champion in Visayas. And the day my Mother decided to transfer me in Digos
        City to continue my High school there which i graduated as High schooler and moving up to Senior High School. My
        Tita(Lucille Jayne) a teacher in UM digos College told me to enroll in UM and star my Senior High School, and so
        far i made tons of friends and learn alot of things
